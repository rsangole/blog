## 

Hello, my name is Rahul. This is a blog where I write about R and data science.

I’m a data scientist at Apple where my work focuses on time-series, R in production and Shiny dashboarding. Before [Apple](https://www.apple.com), I worked as a data science manager at [Cummins](https://www.cummins.com) where I focused on developing time-series anomaly detection algorithms for [engine health monitoring](https://www.cummins.com/parts-and-service/digital-products-and-services/preventech-mining). In my former career, I worked as a mechanical engineer with a focus on computational stress, vibration and fatigue modeling.

I have a Master’s degree in Predictive Analytics from Northwestern University and another in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan.

# list names of post folders
posts <- list.dirs(
  path = here::here("posts"),
  full.names = FALSE,
  recursive = FALSE
)

# extract the slugs
slugs <- gsub("^.*_", "", posts)

# lines to insert to a netlify _redirect file
redirects <- paste0("/", slugs, " ", "/posts/", posts)

# write the _redirect file
writeLines(redirects, here::here("_site", "_redirects"))
```
