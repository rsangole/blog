**tl;dr**: I've come to love `lattice` over `ggplot` in the past few months working with large datasets. Some of the reasons why are listed here.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(lattice)
library(caret)
data("Sacramento")
```

# Plots I really like

# Performance comparison

```{r}
histogram(price~sqft|type,Sacramento)
```

```{r}
ggplot(Sacramento, aes(x=sqft, fill=type))+
    geom_histogram()
```
