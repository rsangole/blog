I had the pleasure of presenting a workshop for _Docker for R Users_ at the [2022 useR Conference](https://user2022.r-project.org/program/tutorials/#docker-for-r-users) with Rami Krispin.

Docker is one of the main tools for reproducibility, CI/CD and automation, productionize, and MLops. In this tutorial, you will learn the foundation of Docker with applications for R programming. That includes creating Docker images, setting an R development environment, and deploying R code on Github Actions with a container.

The presentation is published [here](https://github.com/rsangole/user2022-r-for-docker/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Docker%20for%20R%20users.pdf).
