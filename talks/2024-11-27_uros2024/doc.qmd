I had the pleasure of talking about this topic at the [2024 uRos](https://r-project.ro/conference2024-live.html) conference held in Greece in Nov 2024. I spoke about how very simple tooling in {shiny}, combined with {arrow} can unlock the capability to develop some very powerful interactive tooling in R. I spoke about how we can be quickly scale up our development using shiny modules.
