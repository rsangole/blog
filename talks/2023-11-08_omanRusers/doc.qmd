I had the pleasure of presenting to the [Oman R Users group](https://www.meetup.com/oman-r-user/).

Explore the nuances of handling large datasets in R through the Arrow package. My session aimed to provide an understanding of Arrow's capabilities, detailing its application in real-world scenarios. It's a package that's not only easy to adopt, but one that will drastically improve your capability to handle massive datasets in R.
