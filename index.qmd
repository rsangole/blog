::: {.column-page}

I'm Rahul. I’m a data science manager at Apple where my work focuses on time-series analyses and forecasting, building data science solutions with open-source tools like R, Python and Shiny. Before Apple, as a data science manager at [Cummins](https://www.cummins.com) I developed  time-series anomaly detection algorithms for [engine health monitoring](https://www.cummins.com/parts-and-service/digital-products-and-services/preventech-mining); as a 6 sigma black belt, I solved complex global business problems, and as mechanical engineer, I wore many hats in the areas of mechanical stress and vibration work.

I have a Master’s degree in Predictive Analytics from Northwestern University, and a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan.

# extract the slugs

# lines to insert to a netlify _redirect file
redirects <- paste0("/", slugs, " ", "/posts/", posts)

# write the _redirect file
writeLines(redirects, here::here("_site", "_redirects"))
