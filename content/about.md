Hello, my name is Rahul. This is a blog where I write about R and data science. 

I'm a data scientist at Apple where my work focuses on time-series forecasting and dashboarding. Before Apple, I worked as a data science manager at Cummins, an automotive engineering company, where I focused on developing time-series anomaly detection algorithms for engine health monitoring. In my former career, I worked as a mechanical engineer with a focus on computational stress, vibration and fatigue modeling.

I have a Master's degree in Predictive Analytics from [Northwesten University](https://www.northwestern.edu) and a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu).
