<div id="whats-the-objective" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s the Objective?</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is the dataset used for the SIAM 2007 Text Mining competition.</li>
<li>This competition focused on developing text mining algorithms for document classification.</li>
<li>The documents in question were aviation safety reports that documented one or more problems that occurred during certain flights.</li>
<li>The goal was to label the documents with respect to the types of problems that were described. This is a subset of the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) dataset, which is publicly available.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data is obtained from <a href="https://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/resources/138/">this link</a>.</p>
<p>My entire code base is stored <a href="https://github.com/rsangole/453_TextAnalysis_FinalProject">on github</a>.</p>

<h2>Quick look at the data</h2>
<div id="view-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>View the data</h3>
<p>The training data looks like this: two columns: 1st column is the dsid_id, and the 2nd column is the actual text. Each row represents one safety issue.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(training_data,2) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   doc_id text

<p>The training data labels look like this. This is the response variable in the original challenge. There are 22 total categories, and a dsid can exist in multiple categories.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(training_labels,2)</code></pre>

<h3>Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a very large dataset: [21519, 2].</li>
<li>There are 22 total categories which might make things complicated.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can I simplify this?</p>
<div id="simplifying-things-for-phase-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Simplifying things for Phase 1</h4>
<p>I could simply randomly sample 100-1000 DSIDs to make things easier. But, I’ll still end up with a mixture of categories. I can do one better. Here are the total sum of DSIDs in each category. <code>b</code> and <code>s</code> are the most common. Let’s focus on these.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(colSums(training_labels)+21519) %&gt;% tail(-1) %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% rownames_to_column() %&gt;% mutate(rowname=reorder(rowname,.)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(rowname,.))+geom_col()+coord_flip()+labs(x=&#39;dsid category&#39;,y=&#39;count of dsid&#39;,caption=&#39;All Training Data&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/project/2018-02-27-453-text-analytics-class-project-aviation-safety-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<div id="how-many-common-dsids-between-b-and-s" class="section level5">
<h5>How many common dsids between b and s?</h5>
<p>A majority of issues are unique to <code>b</code> and <code>s</code>. So what I’ll do is to randomly sample 200 dsids from <code>b</code> and <code>s</code> each.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   b_and_s     n
##   &lt;lgl&gt;   &lt;int&gt;
## 1 F       18229
## 2 T        3290</code></pre>
<p>This will make things more managable for me, while hoping that the selected dsids have some unique underlying stucture.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1)
training_labels %&gt;% 
    mutate(b_and_s = ifelse(cat_b==1 &amp; cat_s==1,T,F)) %&gt;% 
    filter(!b_and_s) %&gt;%
    group_by(cat_b, cat_s) %&gt;%

    ungroup() %&gt;% 
    filter(cat_b==1 | cat_s==1)-&gt; sub_train_labels

</div>
<div id="what-does-the-raw-text-tell-us" class="section level3">
<h3>What does the raw text tell us?</h3>
<p>If you notice the raw text itself, there’s something interesting going on. Take for example the first line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>print(sub_training_data$text[1])</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;WE WERE JUST ABOUT AT bdl airport AND I request DIRECT TO SAX.airtrafficcontrol say THEY COULDN T BUT THEY clear US DIRECT TO ignition.I readback THE clearance AS I understand IT DIRECT TO ignition.IN LATER converse IT appear airtrafficcontrol THOUGHT THEY clear US DIRECT ignition THEN DIRECT SAX.THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.approach SAX airtrafficcontrol GAVE US _ degree head WHICH WE AGAIN readback.IN A LATER converse IT appear HE THOUGHT HE clear US DIRECT TO SAX THEN _ degree head.NONE OF US hear IT THAT WAY AND IT WAS NOT readback THAT WAY.IT seem THAT THERE IS NO INCENTIVE FOR airtrafficcontrol TO LISTEN TO readback AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE understand THE WAY THEY WERE mean.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>There are some words in UPPERCASE while others in lowercase. The UPPERCASE words seem to be stopwords, for the most part. The words in lowercase are much more interesting. Since the dataset had already undergone <code>PLADS</code>, which performs stemming, acronym expansion, and other basic pre-processing operations, the lowercase letters seem to be what we called EquivalenceClasses to take into an RTV.</p>
<div id="uppercase-words" class="section level5">
<h5>UPPERCASE words</h5>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_text &lt;- sub_training_data %&gt;%
    unnest_tokens(word, text, to_lower = F) %&gt;% 
    mutate(lower = word==str_to_lower(word))
tidy_text %&gt;% 
    filter(lower == F) %&gt;%
    count(word, sort = T) %&gt;%
    filter(n &gt; 1e3) %&gt;%
    mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
    geom_col() +
    coord_flip()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/project/2018-02-27-453-text-analytics-class-project-aviation-safety-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>If the stop words are removed from the UPPERCASE words, we do find words that may add value, but are very infrequent in number.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_text %&gt;%
    filter(lower == F) %&gt;%
    mutate(word = str_to_lower(word)) %&gt;%
    anti_join(stop_words) %&gt;%

    count(word, sort = T) %&gt;%

</div>
<div id="lowercase-words" class="section level5">
<h5>Lowercase words</h5>
<p>The lowercase words most certainly are more interesting aviation related words.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sub_training_data %&gt;%

    mutate(lower = word==str_to_lower(word)) %&gt;%

<h2>Topic Modeling using LDA</h2>
<p>To investigate if the two categories <code>b</code> and <code>s</code> are different from each other, I’m going to run an LDA with 2 categories. But first, a little bit of clean up is needed. Converting all text to lower, removing stop words, removing punctuation, and stemming the words first. Here’s what a dsid looks like after these activities.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>text &lt;- sub_training_data %&gt;% pull(text)

    tm_map(removePunctuation) %&gt;% 
    tm_map(stripWhitespace)

<p>Finally, running the LDA analysis on this <code>dtm</code>. The LDA is modeled with 2 topics.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>aviation_lda &lt;- LDA(dtm, k=2, control=list(seed=1234))
aviation_lda</code></pre>
<pre><code>## A LDA_VEM topic model with 2 topics.</code></pre>
<p>The beta value shown here is the probability that that particular word came from that particular topic. For example, the word <code>airport</code> has a 1.7% probability that it belongs to topic 1 and 1.2% probability it comes from topic 2. Fairly equal. <code>caseapproach</code>on the other hand has a 1e-5 probability it belongs to topic 1 compared to 1e-90 probability it comes from topic 2. Very strongly belongs to topic 1.</p>

<h3>Vizualing the results</h3>
<p>The beta coefficients can be extracted and plotted for the two topics. Right away we can make a few observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Topic 1 seems to be related to the aircraft doing something on the runway perhaps, during an approach for landing, perhaps something to do with clearance or asking for new vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Topic 2 seems to be about the captain or flight attendant or passengers reporting a problem or emergency, perhaps with an engine.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Right away, we can see two very different topics.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># densityplot(~beta,groups=topic,aviation_topics,plot.points=F,ylim = c(-1,1000))
aviation_top_terms &lt;- aviation_topics %&gt;%
    group_by(topic) %&gt;%
    top_n(15, beta) %&gt;%
    ungroup() %&gt;%
    arrange(topic, -beta)

aviation_top_terms %&gt;%
    mutate(term = reorder(term, beta)) %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(term, beta, fill = factor(topic))) +
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = &quot;free&quot;) +
    coord_flip()</code></pre>

<p>Another way to vizualise the differences in the two topics is to plot the log2() ratio of topic2:topic1. This will highlight those words which have the MOST difference in the two topics. Right away, we can see that flightattendant is very important to topic 2, vs tower &amp; runway is important to topic 1.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>beta_spread &lt;- aviation_topics %&gt;%
    mutate(topic = paste0(&quot;topic&quot;, topic)) %&gt;%
    spread(topic, beta) %&gt;%
    filter(topic1 &gt; 0.006 | topic2 &gt; 0.006) %&gt;%
    mutate(log_ratio_21 = log2(topic2 / topic1))

ggplot(beta_spread,aes(reorder(term,log_ratio_21),log_ratio_21))+
    geom_col()+
    coord_flip()</code></pre>
