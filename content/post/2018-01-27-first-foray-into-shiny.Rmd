[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) had interested me for a while for it's power to quickly communicate and vizualise data and models. I hadn't delved into it due to lack of time to do so, until now.

Two quick visualizations I've created as my 1st foray into R Shiny. Nothing earth shattering, but was helpful to learn the tool.
