This is part one of the two part post related to Docker, Postgres Databases and Anomaly datasets.

# Background

In recent LinkedIn posts ( [Mine]() and [Rami's Repost](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rami-krispin_anomalydetection-data-timeseries-activity-6825126331672612864-MEks)) and Tweet, I asked the internet for their favorite datasets for anomaly detection problems, particularly in the  time-series domain. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("gadenbuie/tweetrmd")
library(tweetrmd)

```

I'll layout the three posts like so:

1. Part I - This post, will layout how I've setup my new workflow with Postgres & RStudio using Docker
1. Part II - I'll compile the sources of data for anomaly detection datasets, and my personal setup

## How to setup a local dockerized Postgres database from scratch

1. Pull postgres docker image using `docker pull postgres:13.3`
1. Edit `00-postgres-init.sh` with your custom settings
1. Run `./00-postgres-init.sh`, this sets up new roles + new databases
1. Check the configuration in `docker-compose.yml` for your postgres database settings and docker images
1. To run RStudio and Postgres together, run `docker-compose up -d`
1. Connect to RStudio in a browser using `localhost:8787`
1. Test your database by running `postgres.R`

As a short cut to run docker & open a browser for RStudio, run `docker-compose up -d; firefox localhost:8787`
